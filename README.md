# Raspberry Pi zero w as multi gadget

This is a repository I created for my side project: multi-usage respberry-pi-0-w usb plug

I want to use it to act as:

* Bluetooth-to-HID: translate bluetooth keyboard and mouse signal into HID signal
* Bluetooth-to-MIDI: translate music from computer to headphone via bluetooth
